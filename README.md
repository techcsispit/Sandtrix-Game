# Sandtrix Clone

## About
This is a clone of the original game [SANDTRIX](http://sandtrix.net/) made in Python. All game logic is original except for the basics of block spawning, which follow a Tetris tutorial. The game is still a work in progress and not fully complete.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Pygame
- NumPy

### Installation
Run the following command to install the required packages:
```
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Broken Things to be Fixed:
- [ ] Out of bound errors in path-finding algorithm - There's an issue with blocks moving outside of the intended play area.
- [ ] Sand clearance mechanism - Implement a mechanism to clear sand and gain points.
- [ ] Game over mechanism - Include proper game-over logic and allow the game to reset after.
- [ ] Next block shape and color display - Display the next blockâ€™s shape and color in a side panel for better player experience.

## Things to be Added:
- [ ] Proper game UI interactive with mouse - A fully functional user interface that responds to mouse inputs.
- [ ] Background music and sound effects - Add background music and game sounds for more immersion.
- [ ] Game start screen with title and art - Create a visually appealing start screen with game title and artwork.
- [ ] Game special effects - Introduce visual effects to enhance gameplay, like animations or particle effects.
